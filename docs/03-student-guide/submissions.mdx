# 📤 Submitting Assignments

In Classmoji, assignments are submitted by working on a specific branch in your repository and then **closing the GitHub issue** assigned to you.

Here’s how it works:

## 📁 Step 1: Open Your Assignment

Each assignment will appear as an **issue** in your personal GitHub repository for that class module.

You’ll also see:

- The branch name where you should do your work
- A due date
- Instructions from your instructor

:::info
Your instructor might have multiple assignments per module, each with its own issue.
:::

## 🌿 Step 2: Complete Your Work on the Right Branch

Switch to the branch listed in the assignment (e.g., `part1`, `lab2`), then:

1. Add or edit your code
2. Commit and push your changes
3. Make sure all necessary files are included

:::warning
Don’t commit to `main` unless your instructor says so.
:::

## ✅ Step 3: Close the Issue to Submit

Once your work is complete:

1. Go to the assignment issue in GitHub
2. Click **“Close issue”**

That’s it! Closing the issue tells Classmoji you’ve submitted the assignment.

Classmoji will:

- Record the submission time
- Trigger auto-grading (if configured)
- Check if it’s on time or late (and apply tokens if needed)

## 🔁 Can I Reopen or Resubmit?

You can reopen and re-close the issue, but only the **latest closure** is used for grading and lateness.  
If your instructor allows resubmissions, you’ll be able to update your code and submit again.
