# 📤 Submitting Assignments

In Classmoji, assignments are submitted by **closing the GitHub issue** assigned to you.

Here’s how it works:

## 📁 Step 1: Open Your Assignment

Each assignment will appear as an **issue** in your personal GitHub repository for that class module.

:::info
Your instructor might have multiple assignments per module, each with its own issue.

  alt='Assignment Issue'
  className='rounded'
  src='/guide/student_view_github_issue.png'
/>

## 🌿 Step 2: Complete Your Work

Complete your work by:

1. Adding or editing your code
2. Committing and pushing your changes
3. Making sure all necessary files are included

## ✅ Step 3: Close the Issue to Submit

Once your work is complete:

1. Go to the assignment issue in GitHub
2. Click **“Close issue”**

That’s it! Closing the issue tells Classmoji you’ve submitted the assignment.

Classmoji will:

- Record the submission time
- Check if it’s on time or late
