# 🪙 Using Tokens

Tokens are a flexible way to manage deadlines without needing to email your instructor. You can spend tokens to submit late, request extensions, or (in some classes) earn extra credit.

## 🧾 What Are Tokens?

Tokens are like classroom currency. You start the term with a set number of tokens (defined by your instructor), and you can spend them when:

- You miss a deadline and still want full credit
- You need more time to finish an assignment

## 🕒 Late Submissions

If you close an assignment issue **after the deadline**, Classmoji will automatically:

- Calculate how many hours late you are
- Check how many tokens you need based on the “tokens per hour” setting
- Deduct the correct number of tokens from your balance

If you don’t have enough tokens, your submission may be marked late and lose points—depending on your instructor’s policy.

## 🎁 Earning and Spending Tokens

You may earn tokens by:

- Submitting great work (some emojis give bonus tokens!)
- Completing extra credit
- Getting a manual bonus from your instructor

You may spend tokens on late work.

:::tip[🧠 USE THEM WISELY]
Tokens are meant to support flexibility and reduce stress—but they are limited. Use them when you need them most, and plan ahead for big projects or unexpected delays.
