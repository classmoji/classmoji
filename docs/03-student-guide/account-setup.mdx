# 🧑‍💻 Setting Up Your Account

Getting started with Classmoji takes just a few steps—and you only need to do it once.

## ✅ Step 1: Log in with GitHub

Click **“Sign In** to sign into Classmoji. We’ll use your GitHub account to:

- Match you to your classroom
- Create your assignment repositories
- Track submissions and grading

:::warning[No GitHub account?]
Don’t have a GitHub account yet? [Create one here](https://github.com/join) before logging in.
:::

## 🪪 Step 2: Confirm Your Identity (First-Time Only)

The first time you log in, you’ll be asked to confirm:

- Your **school email**
- Your **student ID**

This helps your instructor make sure the right work is associated with the right student.

You won’t need to do this again after the first time.

## 🏫 Step 3: Join Your Class

Once you’re logged in, you’ll see **cards** for each class you’ve been invited to.

Click on your class card to:

- Trigger a GitHub invite to the course’s organization
- Check your email for the invite
- Accept it to gain access to your private module repositories
