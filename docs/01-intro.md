# 👋 Welcome to Classmoji

**Classmoji** is a modern alternative to GitHub Classroom designed for instructors who care about feedback, fairness, and student engagement. Whether you're teaching a large lecture or a small seminar, Classmoji simplifies assignment workflows while encouraging iterative learning.

## 🎯 What Is Classmoji?

Classmoji is a teaching platform that integrates with GitHub to let you:

- Create repositories and assignments for students automatically
- Use **emojis** to grade instead of intimidating numbers
- Reward students with **tokens** they can use to get deadline extensions
- Let students **resubmit** assignments based on feedback
- Reduce TA workload by **auto-assigning graders** and supporting auto-grading

It’s GitHub-based, but **student-friendly**.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Module**: A GitHub repository created per student or team
- **Assignment**: A GitHub issue inside a module that students "submit" by closing
- **Grading**: Driven by expressive emojis that map to scores, tokens, and comments
- **Tokens**: A flexible system students use to manage late work or unlock resubmits

## 💡 Why Use Classmoji?

- ✅ **Save time** on repo setup and grading logistics
- 😊 **Give better feedback** using emoji-based grading
- 🕒 **Handle late work fairly** with a token system
- 🔁 **Encourage revision** with resubmission workflows
- 👥 **Support teams** and scale grading across TAs
