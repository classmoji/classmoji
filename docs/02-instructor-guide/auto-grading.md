# ü§ñ Auto-Grading with GitHub Actions

Classmoji supports automated grading by running tests inside each student's repository using **GitHub Actions**.

When students push their code to the assigned branch, a GitHub workflow is triggered. This workflow runs your tests and generates a score based on the results.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. You include a test suite and a workflow file in your **template repository**.
2. Classmoji copies this repo to create each student's assignment repository.
3. On each push to the specified branch, the GitHub Action runs and computes a grade.
4. The grade is recorded and shown in the Classmoji instructor dashboard.

You are responsible for writing your own tests and workflows. We provide examples in our template repo to help you get started.

## üßæ Example: Node.js + Jest Auto-Grading Workflow

Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/grade.yml`) for a Node.js assignment that uses **Jest** to run tests:

```yaml
name: Run Tests
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Jest tests
        run: npx jest sum.test.js
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Read CTRF report
        id: read_report
        uses: brunchlabs/read-test-report-action@main

      - name: Run autograder
        uses: brunchlabs/run-autograder-action@main
        with:
          report: ${{ steps.read_report.outputs.content }}
```

## üìï Key Concepts

- **Workflow File Name**: When you create an assignment in Classmoji, you specify the name of the workflow file (e.g., `grade.yml`).
- **Branch Trigger**: The workflow will only run on the branch specified in the assignment.

## üß© Report Format: CTRF

Classmoji uses a unified test report format called **CTRF** (Classmoji Test Result Format) to interpret student test results, regardless of what language or framework you're using.

### What is CTRF?

CTRF is a JSON-based test report format created to unify the structure of test result reports across various tools and frameworks.

- Ensures consistent report format across different testing tools
- Compatible with any programming language and testing framework
- Facilitates easy integration and analysis through a standardized structure

## üîß How to Generate a CTRF Report

The CTRF format is an open-source initiative that provides reporters for a variety of widely used testing frameworks. These include popular tools such as Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, JUnit, and many others. This open-source approach ensures that you can generate CTRF reports across different languages and frameworks, facilitating seamless integration with GitHub Actions for automated grading.

## üîß Supported Languages

You can use any language that works with GitHub Actions. We provide example workflows for:

- Node.js (Jest, Mocha)
- Python (pytest)
- Java (JUnit)
- C++ (Google Test)

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Keep tests scoped and fast
- Use `continue-on-error: true` to ensure all steps complete
- Always commit your workflow and test files to the template repo before publishing a module
- Use unique branch names per assignment (e.g., `part1`, `lab2`) to isolate auto-grading logic
