# 📝 Adding Students to Your Classroom

Once your GitHub Organization is connected and your Classmoji classroom is set up, you’re ready to enroll students. Classmoji offers two ways to add students: manually one at a time, or in bulk via a CSV class roster.

## ➕ Option 1: Add a Single Student

You can manually add individual students by providing:

- **Full Name**
- **School Email**
- **School ID** (e.g., from registrar system)

After submitting this info, Classmoji will send an email inviting the student to join your classroom and link their GitHub account.

## 📋 Option 2: Upload a Class Roster (CSV)

To add multiple students at once:

1. Prepare a `.csv` file with the following columns:

```
id,name,email
123456,Ada Lovelace,ada@example.edu
789012,Alan Turing,alan@example.edu
```

2. Upload the CSV using the **Add Roster** feature in the Classmoji dashboard.

Each student will receive an email with a link to confirm their identity and connect their GitHub account.

## 🔗 What Happens Next?

When a student clicks the invite link, they will be prompted to:

1. Confirm their **school email** and **student ID**
2. Authorize access to their **GitHub account**
3. Be automatically added to your classroom’s **GitHub Organization** and students team on Github

:::tip

- You can add new students at any time (e.g., for late enrollment)
- Even if student does not get Classmoji email invite, they can still access the platform as long as you've added
