# 🧑🏽‍🏫 Teaching Assistants

Classmoji makes it easy to collaborate with **Teaching Assistants (TAs)** by streamlining repo access andgrading workflows.

You can assign TAs to grade specific students, modules, or entire classes—all without manually managing GitHub permissions.

## 👥 Adding TAs to a Classroom

To add a TA:

1. Go to your assignments page
2. Enter the TA’s **name**, **email**, and their **GitHub username**

Once added, Classmoji will automatically:

- Invite the TA to the classroom’s GitHub organization
- Grant access to relevant student repositories
- Display grading assignments in their TA dashboard

## 📘 Assigning TAs to Students or Modules

You can assign TAs in two ways:

### Manual Assignment

- Choose specific TAs to grade a student or module
- Useful for small classes or when TAs follow particular sections

### Auto-Assignment

- Let Classmoji evenly distribute grading responsibilities
- Automatically assigns TAs based on availability and load balancing

:::info
You can reassign TAs at any time—even after work is submitted.

## ✏️ TA Grading Tools

Each TA sees a **grading dashboard** showing:

- Repositories they’re assigned to
- Student submissions that need grading
- All class submissions

Once a TA submits a grade, it’s visible to the student immediately—unless you’ve disabled grade visibility.

:::tip[Best Practices]

- Assign TAs to students or teams early to avoid confusion
- Encourage use of consistent emoji feedback
- Check TA progress from the instructor dashboard to ensure timely grading
