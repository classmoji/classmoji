# 🎯 Emoji Grading System

Classmoji replaces traditional number-based grading with a flexible, emoji-powered system that emphasizes **feedback, clarity, and motivation**.

Each emoji corresponds to a score, a number of tokens, and a feedback explanation—making grades more expressive and easier to interpret.

## 😊 Why Emoji Grading?

- Lowers stress compared to numeric scores
- Makes feedback more immediate and intuitive
- Encourages reflection and resubmission
- Supports partial credit and token rewards

Emoji-based grading is **customizable per classroom**, giving instructors complete control over the grading philosophy they want to adopt.

## 🧩 Emoji-to-Score Mapping

You can configure the emoji grading scale in your **Classroom Settings** to reflect your own teaching style and expectations.

Example configuration:

| Emoji | Score | Tokens | Feedback Description                                                                               |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔥    | 100   | +2     | Exceptional work that goes beyond expectations; demonstrated creativity or advanced understanding. |
| 👍    | 90    | +1     | Solid and complete; met the core requirements effectively.                                         |
| 👀    | 70    | 0      | Almost there; needs some revision to fully meet expectations.                                      |
| 👎    | 50    | 0      | Major elements missing or incorrect; incomplete understanding.                                     |
| 😭    | 30    | 0      | Work submitted but critically flawed; does not address the core task.                              |

You can customize the emojis, scores, token values, and feedback descriptions to match your course’s tone and grading philosophy.

## 🔡 Letter Grade Mapping

Classmoji also allows you to define how **average numeric scores** convert into **letter grades**.

Example:

| Score Range | Grade |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 93–100      | A     |
| 85–92       | B     |
| 75–84       | C     |
| 65–74       | D     |
| 0–64        | F     |
