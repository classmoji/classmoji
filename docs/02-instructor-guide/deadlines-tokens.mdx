# ⏳ Deadlines & Tokens

Classmoji offers a flexible system for managing assignment deadlines using a **token-based extension system**. This helps you enforce structure while also supporting students who need extra time.

## 📅 Setting Deadlines

When you create an assignment, you specify a **student deadline** — the latest time a student can submit work without penalty.

You can also set a **grader deadline**, which tells TAs or instructors when feedback and grading should be completed.

## 🪙 What Are Tokens?

Each student starts with a configurable number of **tokens** for the term. They can spend these tokens to submit assignments after the deadline without a grade penalty.

- Instructors define how many tokens are required to extend the deadline by 1 hour
- Instructors can manually award or refund tokens at any time

:::note
This approach encourages responsibility and gives students agency, without needing constant deadline exception handling.

## ⚙️ How to Configure Token Settings

In each assignment, you can specify:

- **Student Deadline** – the submission cutoff time
- **Tokens per Hour** – how many tokens students need to extend their deadline by 1 hour

You can also set **default token values** for the classroom in your Classroom Settings.

## 📊 Instructor View

Instructors and TAs can view:

- Total tokens each student has used
- Current token balance
- Whether an assignment was submitted late, and by how many hours

## 🔁 Token Use Cases

- Extend submission deadlines without needing one-on-one email approvals
- Reward tokens as extra credit

## ✅ Best Practices

- Make the token system transparent to students from day one
- Use consistent token-to-hour ratios across assignments
- Encourage students to track their usage and save tokens for emergencies
