# ðŸŽ¯ Emoji Grading System

Classmoji replaces traditional number-based grading with a flexible, emoji-powered system that emphasizes **feedback, clarity, and motivation**.

Each emoji corresponds to a score, a number of tokens, and a feedback explanationâ€”making grades more expressive and easier to interpret.

- Lowers stress compared to numeric scores
- Makes feedback more immediate and intuitive
- Supports partial credit and token rewards

Emoji-based grading is **customizable per classroom**, giving instructors complete control over the grading philosophy they want to adopt.
