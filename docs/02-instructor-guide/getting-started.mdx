Welcome! Before you create a classroom on Classmoji, you’ll first need to set up a **GitHub Organization**. This is essential because Classmoji uses GitHub repositories and issues to manage assignments and submissions.

## 🧱 Create a GitHub Organization

1. Go to [github.com/organizations/new](https://github.com/organizations/new)
2. Choose a clear, short name for your classroom (e.g., `schoolname-cs52-25s`)
3. Set the organization owner to your personal GitHub account
4. Select the **Free Plan** (Classmoji works without GitHub Enterprise)

:::tip
Use a different GitHub Organization for each course and term to keep repositories separate and organized.
:::

Once your GitHub Organization is ready, you're all set to [create your classroom in Classmoji](./adding-students.md).

## 🛠️ Add the Classmoji GitHub App to Your Organization

After creating your GitHub Organization, you'll need to authorize Classmoji to manage repositories, issues, and pull requests on your behalf.

1. Click on the sign in button top right of the page

2. Click **Add new class** button after you've signed in

3. Select the **organization** you just created (e.g., `schoolname-cs52-25s`)

4. Under **Repository Access**, choose:

   - ✅ _All repositories_ (recommended), or
   - ⬜ _Only select repositories_ (for advanced use)

5. Click **Install** to authorize the app.

:::info[JUST TO BE CLEAR 😅]
Classmoji only uses the permissions it needs to create student repositories, manage assignments (as issues), and enable auto-grading.
:::

Once installed, you will be redirected to yourclassrooms list and Classmoji will be connected to your GitHub Organization and ready to help you manage assignments and grading automatically.
