# 📤 Submitting Assignments

In Classmoji, students submit their work using **GitHub issues and branches**, following the same workflows used in professional software development.

This guide explains how submission works and what instructors need to configure.

## 📝 Assignment Format

Each assignment in Classmoji is created as a **GitHub issue** inside a student's (or team’s) module repository.

- Students complete the work and push it to their repository
- Once they're done, they **close the issue** to signal submission
- Classmoji uses the issue closure timestamp to determine if the work was submitted on time
