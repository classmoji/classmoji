# 🎯 Classmoji

**From 🤷 to 🎯 all in one platform.**

Classmoji is a modern teaching platform that transforms how educators manage coding assignments. Built as a GitHub-native alternative to traditional classroom tools, it combines the power of version control with intuitive, emoji-based grading and flexible deadline management.

## ✨ What Makes Classmoji Special

**🎨 Emoji-Powered Grading**  
Replace intimidating numbers with expressive emojis. Each emoji maps to scores, token rewards, and feedback descriptions—making grades more human and less stressful.

**🪙 Token-Based Flexibility**  
Give students agency over their deadlines. They can spend tokens to submit late work without penalty, eliminating the need for constant extension requests.

**🤖 Seamless GitHub Integration**

- Auto-creates repositories for every student or team
- Uses GitHub Issues as assignments
- Supports auto-grading via GitHub Actions
- Maintains real-world development workflows
