## ✨ What Makes Classmoji Special

**🎨 Emoji-Powered Grading**  
Replace intimidating numbers with expressive emojis. Each emoji maps to scores, token rewards, and feedback descriptions—making grades more human and less stressful.

**🪙 Token-Based Flexibility**  
Give students agency over their deadlines. They can spend tokens to submit late work without penalty, eliminating the need for constant extension requests.

**🤖 Seamless GitHub Integration**

- Auto-creates repositories for every student or team
- Uses GitHub Issues as assignments
- Maintains real-world development workflows

**👥 Built for Scale**  
From small seminars to large lectures, Classmoji handles TA assignment, grading distribution, and progress tracking automatically.
