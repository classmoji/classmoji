### What is Classmoji?
Classmoji is a Git-native LMS, think Github Classroom but built for how CS is actually practiced. Every assignment lives in a repo, instructors get automated workflows and real teaching tools, and nobody has to fight a clunky interface to make it happen.

We used to use Github Classroom and loved it, but we needed more, so we started this project almost 4 years ago. One small python script that started it all.
