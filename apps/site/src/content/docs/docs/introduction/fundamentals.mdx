### How Classmoji maps to Github

If you've used Github before, Classmoji will feel familiar. Everything in Classmoji has a Github counterpart:

| Github | Classmoji | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Organization | Classroom(s) | One org can hold multiple classrooms, e.g. different semesters of the same course. |
| Repository | Module | Each module maps to a repo, grouping related assignments together. |
| Issue | Assignment | Each assignment is a Github issue, tied to the module repo. |

Everything stays in Github where your code already lives.

### Classrooms

A classroom is scoped to a Github organization, but one org can hold multiple classrooms. For example, a teacher might use the same Github organization for the same course they teach in different semesters.

### Modules

Modules group related assignments, quizzes, pages, and slides together, similar to a unit or week. You can weight modules for grading and mark them as extra credit.

### Assignments

Assignments are Github issues inside a module repo. Each assignment tracks a student's work within the context of that module, keeping everything organized in the same place your code lives.

### Emoji Grading

Instead of numeric scores, Classmoji uses emoji to represent grades. Each emoji maps to a grade range. The goal is feedback that feels less punitive and more expressive. If you've only ever graded with numbers, this feels weird for about one week. Then you won't want to go back.

### Tokens

Tokens are a flexible deadline extension system. Students get a set number of tokens per term and spend them to push due dates, no email required. Assign them at the start of the semester — either way, your inbox stays quiet.

### Memberships and Roles

Everyone in a classroom has a role: Admin, Assistant, or Student. Roles control what each person can see and do. Assistants can grade but not configure the classroom; students can only access their own work.
