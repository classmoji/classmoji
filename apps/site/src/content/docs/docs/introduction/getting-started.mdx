### Create an account

Classmoji uses Github for authentication, no separate password needed.

1. Go to [app.classmoji.io](https://app.classmoji.io) and click **Continue with Github**
2. Authenticate with your Github account
3. Enter your school email and verify it with the 6-digit code sent to your inbox
4. Fill in your name and school ID (your Github username is pre-filled)
5. You're in. You'll land on the classroom selection page.

### What's next?

Your path depends on your role:

- **Instructor** - create a classroom. See the [instructor guide](/docs/docs/instructors) to get your first one up.
- **Student or Assistant** - once your instructor adds you, classrooms will automatically show up on your home page. Nothing to set up.
