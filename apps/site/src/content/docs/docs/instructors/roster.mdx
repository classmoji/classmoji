description: How to add students and assistants to your classroom
---

### Adding students

Go to the **Students** tab and click **Add Students** in the top right.

Paste your student list into the textarea, one per line. Export it from your school's system and paste it straight in:

```
Name, Email
John Doe, john@school.edu
Jane Smith, jane@school.edu
```

Before adding, you'll see a preview: valid entries in green, skipped ones in gray with a reason (invalid email, already enrolled, etc.). Confirm to add them all.

What happens next depends on whether they're already on Classmoji:

- **Already on Classmoji**: automatically added to the classroom.
- **New to Classmoji**: sent an email invite to join the platform. Once they sign up, they'll be added to the classroom.

When a student accesses the classroom for the first time, they'll receive a Github organization invite. They need to accept it to access their classroom dashboard and get repo access. (Yes, there's an extra step here. Github's rules, not ours.)

### Adding assistants

Go to the **Assistants** tab and click **New assistant**.

Enter their Github username, name, and email, then confirm.

### Removing someone

Find the person in the table and click **Remove** in the actions column. Pending invites can be revoked the same way. This removes them from the classroom and the Github organization, but any existing data they have stays intact.

### Pending vs Active

- **Pending**: added to the classroom but hasn't joined the Github organization yet
- **Active**: part of both the Classmoji classroom and the Github organization
