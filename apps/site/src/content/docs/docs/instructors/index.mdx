### Before you start

You need to be the admin of a Github organization. If that sentence stressed you out, don't worry. [You can make one in about 30 seconds.](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)

### Step 1: Basic info

Head to [app.classmoji.io](https://app.classmoji.io) and click **Create new class**.

Fill in the following:

- **Github organization**: only orgs where you're admin with the Classmoji app installed will appear. If you haven't installed the app yet, you can do it directly from the dropdown.
- **Classroom name**: something like "CS 101" or "Intro to Systems"
- **Term and year**: Fall, Spring, Summer, or Winter

A slug is auto-generated from your inputs (e.g. `cs-101-25f`). This becomes the classroom's URL and can't be changed later. Pick something readable — you'll be typing it all semester.

### Step 2: Import modules (optional)

If you've run this class before, you can pull modules from a previous classroom. Toggle the import on, pick a source classroom, and select which modules to bring over. Deadlines come in blank so you can set new ones without touching everything else.

A few things to know:
- Deadlines are stripped on import
- Modules and quizzes start unpublished, so nothing is visible to students right away

If this is your first rodeo, skip it.

### Step 3: Review and create

Give everything a final look and hit **Create classroom**. You'll land on the admin dashboard.
