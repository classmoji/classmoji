### How tokens work

Tokens are a flexible deadline extension system. You allocate tokens to students at the start of the term, and they spend them to buy extra hours on a late assignment. No emails, no individual negotiations.

### Setting the token cost

Go to **Settings > Extension** and set **Tokens per hour** — how many tokens it costs a student to extend a deadline by one hour. This default also applies at the assignment level when creating a module, where you can override it per assignment.

### Assigning tokens to students

Go to **Tokens** and click **Assign Tokens**. You can assign to specific students or to everyone at once. Add an optional description like "start of semester allocation" to keep the history readable. Tokens are added to each student's balance immediately. Do this before anyone needs them — it takes 10 seconds and saves a lot of awkward conversations later.

### How students use tokens

After a deadline passes, students see an extension option next to the late assignment on their dashboard. They pick how many hours they want, see the token cost (hours x tokens per hour for that assignment), and confirm. Their deadline extends and their balance is debited.

### Token history

The Tokens page shows a full log of every transaction across the classroom: who received tokens, who spent them, and when. Students can see their own transaction history on their Tokens page. Everything is logged — you'll never have to take anyone's word for it.
