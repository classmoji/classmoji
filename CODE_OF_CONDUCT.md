# 🍎 How We Roll at Classmoji

Classmoji is an educational platform built for students, educators, and developers. Our community includes:

- Students learning to contribute to open source
- Educators using and improving the platform
- Developers building features for CS education
- Researchers studying learning technologies

We recognize that many contributors are new to open source and are here to learn. We're committed to making this a welcoming environment for all skill levels.

## 🤝 Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## ✨ Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
7. **Supporting learning and growth** - Recognizing that contributors have varying levels of experience and actively helping newcomers learn.
8. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

## 🚫 Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
3. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.

4. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

6. **Inappropriate educational relationships.** Exploiting power dynamics between educators and students, or between experienced and new contributors.

## 📣 Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, please email **hello@classmoji.io** or contact the project maintainers directly via GitHub.

For incidents involving student contributors, we will handle reports with particular care regarding privacy and educational context. Reports involving minors will be escalated appropriately.

Community Moderators take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Community Moderators will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.

## 🎓 Student Contributors

We welcome student contributions as part of coursework or independent learning. If you're contributing as a student:

- **Don't copy code without attribution** - If you use code from Stack Overflow, GitHub, or AI tools, cite the source in a comment
- **Credit your collaborators** - If you pair programmed or got help, acknowledge them in your commit message
- **Ask questions freely** - We're here to help you learn. No question is too basic
- **Check with your instructor** - If this is for a class, make sure open-source contributions are allowed for your assignment

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
