# Use Cases

Classmoji is built to support a wide range of teaching styles—from traditional assignments to project-based learning. Below are common classroom scenarios where Classmoji shines.

## 🧑‍🏫 Managing Individual Assignments

Ideal for: Intro courses, programming labs, or data structures

**The challenge:** Creating and managing a repo for each student, ensuring they submit correctly, and giving feedback at scale.

**With Classmoji:**

- Students receive their own repo with preloaded instructions
- Assignments are posted as GitHub issues
- Submissions happen by closing the issue
- Feedback is given through emojis and optional comments
- Auto-grading workflows can run tests automatically

## 👥 Supporting Team Projects

Ideal for: Capstone projects, group-based assignments, or peer collaboration

**The challenge:** Coordinating teams, repos, permissions, and grading fairness.

**With Classmoji:**

- Teams are assigned through the dashboard
- One shared repo is generated per team
- Issues can be created for teams just like individuals
- TAs can be assigned to specific teams
- Feedback and tokens apply to the team, not individuals

## ⚙️ Auto-Grading with GitHub Actions

Ideal for: Short coding exercises, quizzes, or scalable assessments

**The challenge:** Manually checking correctness takes time, especially at scale.

**With Classmoji:**

- You include a test suite in your template repo
- GitHub Actions runs tests when students push code
- Test results are read using a CTRF report
- Autograder assigns emoji-based scores
- Students see instant feedback

## ⏳ Flexible Deadlines with Tokens

Ideal for: Classes that value structure _and_ flexibility

**The challenge:** Handling late submissions without constant exceptions.

**With Classmoji:**

- Students are given tokens at the start of the term
- Submitting late deducts tokens automatically
- No need for instructors to manually approve extensions
- Instructors can award, refund, or restrict token usage

## 🧑‍🏫 Coordinating with Teaching Assistants

Ideal for: Large or multi-section courses with shared grading

**The challenge:** Keeping grading consistent and avoiding duplication.

**With Classmoji:**

- TAs can be assigned manually or auto-distributed across students or modules
- Each TA sees only the repos they’re responsible for
- TA dashboards include submission status, grading forms, and access links
- Emoji feedback keeps grading fast, visible, and human-centered

Each use case is built into Classmoji’s core, so you can mix and match what works for your class.
