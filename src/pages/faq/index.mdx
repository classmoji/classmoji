# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Whether you're an instructor, TA, or student, here are the answers to common questions about using Classmoji.

## 👩‍🏫 Instructor Questions

### What does Classmoji do?

Classmoji helps you manage coding assignments using GitHub. It automates repo creation, uses emoji-based grading, and supports tokens, resubmissions, and auto-grading workflows.

### Do I need GitHub Classroom?

Nope! Classmoji is a standalone alternative. It uses GitHub directly, but handles the organization, repo setup, issue creation, and access control for you.

### Can I customize the emoji grading system?

Yes. You can set your own emojis, scores, token values, and feedback labels in your **Classroom Settings**.

### How do auto-grading and workflows work?

You provide a GitHub Actions workflow and CTRF-compatible test suite in the template repo. Classmoji runs those tests when students push code.

### Can I manage TAs?

Yes. You can assign TAs to students or modules manually, or let Classmoji auto-assign them evenly. TAs get grading dashboards and repo access.

## 🧑‍🎓 Student Questions

### How do I log in?

Click **“Sign In”** on the homepage. If it’s your first time, you’ll also confirm your school email and ID.

### How do I join my class?

After logging in, click your course card to accept the GitHub invite. That gives you access to your assignment repo.

### How do I submit an assignment?

Work on the correct branch, then **close the GitHub issue** linked to the assignment. That’s how Classmoji knows you’re done.

### What are tokens?

Tokens let you submit late work or unlock resubmissions. You start with a set number and spend them as needed. Your instructor decides how they work.

### Can I resubmit work?

If your instructor allows it, yes! Just update your code and send a resubmit request.

### Where do I see my grades?

You’ll see emoji feedback on each assignment. If enabled, your dashboard will also show your current estimated letter grade.
